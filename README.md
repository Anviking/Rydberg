# Rydberg
An experiment to see if Swift can help with writing physics lab reports. Still at a conceptual level.

## Motivation
Managing complicated calculations in Python as well as updating the results in your paper can be very challanging.

### Implemented features
- Create expressions using operator overloads in a type safe way

### Partially implemented features
- Deriving expressions using common derivation rules
- Solve simple equations
- Render expressions as `LaTeX`

### Todo
- Plot equations automatically in an appropriate interval if derivatives can be found.
- Better `LaTeX` support
- Linear Regressions etc.
- Measurements with uncertainties (preferably inferred based on significant digits)
- Better Unit system
- Leverage type system if possible
- More algebraeic functionality
- MathJax?
