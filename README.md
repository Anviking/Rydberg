# Rydberg
An experiment to see if Swift can help with writing physics lab reports. Still at a conceptual level.

## Motivation
Making complicated calculations in Python, and having up to date equations in your paper is difficult.

### Implemented features
- Create expressions using operator overloads in a type safe way

### Partially implemented features
- Deriving expressions using common derivation rules
- Solve simple equations
- Render expressions as `LaTex`

### Todo
- Better `LaTex` support
- Linear Regressions etc.
- Measurements with uncertainties (preferably inferred based on significant digits)
- Better Unit system
- More algebraeic functionality
- MathJax?
